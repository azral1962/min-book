= Translation

Currently, _min-book_ supports automatic translation for all languages
represented by a file in `/src/l10n/` directory. When using other languages,
just create a custom Fluent translation file and set it as `#book(cfg.transl)`.
If no translation file is found or set for the language used, _min-book_ will
`#panic`.

Also consider contributing to the _min-book_ project by submitting a translation
pull request or even opening an issue â€” since most of the
supported languages were originally translated by IA and may contain errors.
