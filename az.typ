  These are the first nine chapters of the book, whose English title would be
  _"Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas"_, originally written in Portuguese by
  Machado de Assis in 1880. The text is in the public domain and can be read in
  full online. For this excerpt, a version with #link(url.newer)[contemporary Portuguese] and also one with #link(url.older)[original spelling] were used
  for comparison; this exact excerpt of nine chapters can be read freely in
  #link(url.en)[English] also.
